The /system/etc/dmi-machine.conf file contains DMI matching
information for recognized devices.  Format is one record per line,
whitespace-separated tokens:

 <name> [dmi-list...]

If all the strings in the list exist as substrings of the kernel DMI
modalias (/sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/modalias) then the property
file "/system/etc/machine-props/<name>.prop" will be read at boot.

The list of known machines can be configured here, or in auxilliary
Android.mk files by adjusting the contents of DMI_MATCH_SRCS (a list
of files containing match specs as above) and MACH_PROP_FILES (a list
of properties files to be loaded).
