Test Plan for the Gummiboot Bootloader on Android Devices


OBJECTIVE:

Test the Gummiboot Bootloader by booting to all possible targets, booting to those targets in all possible ways,
and do some negative testing where the boot targets don't exist.


LIST OF TESTS:

gummiboot.1 : Test booting the device into Android using the Gummiboot menu

gummiboot.2 : Test booting the device to the recovery console using the Gummiboot menu
gummiboot.3 : Test booting the device to the recovery console using the "volume up" button
gummiboot.4 : Test booting the device to the recovery console using the "reboot" command

gummiboot.5 : Test booting the device into fastboot mode using the Gummiboot menu
gummiboot.6 : Test booting the device into fastboot mode using the "volume down" button
gummiboot.7 : Test booting the device into fastboot mode using the "reboot" command

gummiboot.8 : Test booting the device with a corrupted boot partition (negative test)
gummiboot.9 : Test booting the device into fastboot mode with a corrupted fastboot partition (negative test)

TEST DEFINITIONS:

Preperation:

Have a device to test with that has a functional build installed on it
Have that device connected to a host computer via adb (over usb or ethernet)

gummiboot.1:
	Purpose:
	Test booting the device into Android using the Gummiboot menu

	Method:
	Boot the Android device to the Gummiboot menu

gummiboot.6:
	Purpose:
	Test booting the device into fastboot mode using the "volume down" button

	Method:
	Boot the Android device while holding the "volume down" button

	Expected Outcome:
	The Android device should boot into the fastboot console, and you should see the Dead Android Robot graphic

gummiboot.7:
	Purpose:
	Test booting the device into fastboot mode using the "reboot" command

	Method:
	Bring up a shell prompt using either the terminal or the adb command from your host machine
	Type "reboot fastboot"

	Expected Outcome:
	The Android device should boot into the recovery console, and you should see the Dead Android Robot graphic

gummiboot.8:
	Purpose:
	Test booting the device with a corrupted boot partition (negative test)

	Method:
	Boot the Android device to the Gummiboot menu
	Select the Android option and press the Enter key
	Bring up a shell prompt using either the terminal or the adb command from your host machine
	Type "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/block/by-name/boot bs=1024 count=1" to corrupt the boot partition

	Boot the Android device to the Gummiboot menu
	Select the Android option and press the Enter key

	Expected Outcome:
	The Android device should boot into the recovery console, and you should see the Dead Android Robot graphic

gummiboot.9:
	Purpose:
	Test booting the device into fastboot mode with a corrupted fastboot partition (negative test)

	Method:
	Boot the Android device to the Gummiboot menu
	Select the Android option and press the Enter key
	Bring up a shell prompt using either the terminal or the adb command from your host machine
	Type "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/block/by-name/fastboot bs=1024 count=1" to corrupt the fastboot partition

	Boot the Android device to the Gummiboot menu
	Select the fastboot option and press the Enter key

	Expected Outcome:
	The Android device should boot into the currently installed Android OS
	(If the fastboot partition does not exist, the device should fall back to booting to the Android OS)
